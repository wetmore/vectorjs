vector.js
=========

What?
-----

A basic library for common vector operations in 2D. The library also includes a method for annotating the operations with "types" (in practice, just *vector* and *number* that will throw errors when the vector operations are passed parameters of the wrong type.

Why?
---

I wanted a reason to learn more about javascript and the module pattern, and I thought a vector library would be useful for canvas creations.
